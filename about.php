            <h4>Over-medication</h4>
            <p>
              Superbugs are increasingly appearing in food-MRSA in pork,
              resistant salmonella in turkey-and have caused widespread
              outbreaks of food poisoning in the U.S. Because meat and poultry
              producers are not required to report how they use the drugs-which
              ones, how much, what animals-documenting a clear connection
              between.

            <h4>Anti-Biotics in Food</h4>
            <p>
              More antibiotics go into the food we eat than we take ourselves.
              About 80 percent of all antibiotics sold in the United States are
              used on farm animals. Most animals are dosed regularly-sometimes
              even daily-with antibiotic-laced food and water in a practice
              known as subtherapeutic administration.

              Nevertheless, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and
              other government agencies have testified before Congress that
              there is a definitive link between the two. This position is
              supported by the American Medical Association, the American
              Academy of Pediatrics, the World Health Organization and other
              leading public health and medical groups.
